# OpenAlpha_Evolve: Contribute to Improve this Project

![openalpha_evolve_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4709ad-0072-44ae-bbb5-7eea1c5fa08c)

OpenAlpha_Evolve is an open-source Python framework inspired by the groundbreaking research on autonomous coding agents like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It's a **regeneration** of the core idea: an intelligent system that iteratively writes, tests, and improves code using Large Language Models (LLMs) via LiteLLM, guided by the principles of evolution.

Our mission is to provide an accessible, understandable, and extensible platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the fascinating intersection of AI, code generation, and automated problem-solving.

## ✨ The Vision: AI-Driven Algorithmic Innovation

Imagine an agent that can:

*   Understand a complex problem description.
*   Generate initial algorithmic solutions.
*   Rigorously test its own code.
*   Learn from failures and successes.
*   Evolve increasingly sophisticated and efficient algorithms over time.

OpenAlpha_Evolve is a step towards this vision. It's not just about generating code; it's about creating a system that *discovers* and *refines* solutions autonomously.

## 🧠 How It Works: The Evolutionary Cycle

OpenAlpha_Evolve employs a modular, agent-based architecture to orchestrate an evolutionary process:

1.  **Task Definition**: You, the user, define the algorithmic "quest" – the problem to be solved, including examples of inputs and expected outputs.
2.  **Prompt Engineering (`PromptDesignerAgent`)**: This agent crafts intelligent prompts for the LLM. It designs:
    *   *Initial Prompts*: To generate the first set of candidate solutions.
    *   *Mutation Prompts*: To introduce variations and improvements to existing solutions, often requesting changes in a "diff" format.
    *   *Bug-Fix Prompts*: To guide the LLM in correcting errors from previous attempts, also typically expecting a "diff".
3.  **Code Generation (`CodeGeneratorAgent`)**: 默认通过 Azure OpenAI GPT-5-mini（Managed Identity + `azure_api.AzureOpenAIClient`）生成代码，并在 `USE_AZURE_OPENAI=False` 时回退到 LiteLLM/其他提供商。若提示要求输出 diff，代理会尝试将 diff 应用到父代代码。
4.  **Evaluation (`EvaluatorAgent`)**: The generated code is put to the test!
    *   *Syntax Check*: Is the code valid Python?
    *   *Execution*: The code is run in a temporary, isolated environment against the input/output examples defined in the task.
    *   *Fitness Scoring*: Programs are scored based on correctness (how many test cases pass), efficiency (runtime), and other potential metrics.
5.  **Database (`DatabaseAgent`)**: All programs (code, fitness scores, generation, lineage) are stored, creating a record of the evolutionary history (currently in-memory).
6.  **Selection (`SelectionControllerAgent`)**: The "survival of the fittest" principle in action. This agent selects:
    *   *Parents*: Promising programs from the current generation to produce offspring.
    *   *Survivors*: The best programs from both the current population and new offspring to advance to the next generation.
7.  **Iteration**: This cycle repeats for a defined number of generations, with each new generation aiming to produce better solutions than the last.
8.  **Orchestration (`TaskManagerAgent`)**: The maestro of the operation, coordinating all other agents and managing the overall evolutionary loop.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **LLM-Powered Code Generation**: 开箱即用地对接 Azure OpenAI GPT-5（含自定义超时/重试、托管身份认证），并可通过 LiteLLM 回退到任意其他模型提供商。
*   **Evolutionary Algorithm Core**: Implements iterative improvement through selection, LLM-driven mutation/bug-fixing using diffs, and survival.
*   **Modular Agent Architecture**: Easily extend or replace individual components (e.g., use a different LLM, database, or evaluation strategy).
*   **Automated Program Evaluation**: Syntax checking and functional testing against user-provided examples. Code execution is sandboxed using **Docker containers** for improved security and dependency management, with configurable timeout mechanisms.
*   **连续多指标 + 启发式搜索模式**: `TaskDefinition` 现已支持 `evaluation_mode: "metrics"`，用户可挂接自定义 `evaluate_candidate()` 模块返回 `dict[str, float]`，对“搜索器”类程序进行连续、多维打分（主指标 + 线性标量化 + success 优先级），SelectionController 会据此排序。
*   **Configuration Management**: Easily tweak parameters like population size, number of generations, LLM models, API settings, and Docker configurations via `config/settings.py` and `.env`.
*   **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs provide insights into each step of the evolutionary process.
*   **Diff-based Mutations**: The system is designed to use diffs for mutations and bug fixes, allowing for more targeted code modifications by the LLM.
*   **Prompt 多样化**: `PromptDesignerAgent` 在初始/变异/修复阶段都会随机采样多种模板（记录 `prompt_id`），便于后续统计或扩展 “meta-prompt evolution”。
*   **Open Source & Extensible**: Built with Python, designed for experimentation and community contributions.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   `pip` for package management
    *   `git` for cloning
    *   **Docker**: For sandboxed code evaluation. Ensure Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux) is installed and running. Visit [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for installation instructions.

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAlpha_Evolve.git
    cd OpenAlpha_Evolve
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables (必需)**:
    *   仓库当前未附带 `.env_example`，请手动创建 `.env`（或在 shell 中直接导出变量）。
    *   **Azure OpenAI（默认路径）**：
        ```bash
        USE_AZURE_OPENAI=True
        ENDPOINT_URL="https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
        DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-5-mini"
        AZURE_MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID="your-managed-identity-client-id"
        AZURE_API_VERSION="2025-01-01-preview"
        AZURE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
        AZURE_MAX_RETRIES=3
        ```
        需确保运行环境具备可用的 Azure Managed Identity，或在本地设置 `DefaultAzureCredential` 支持的凭据。
    *   **LiteLLM / 其他模型（可选回退）**：当 `USE_AZURE_OPENAI=False` 时，`CodeGeneratorAgent` 使用 LiteLLM 的 `LITELLM_DEFAULT_MODEL`。请根据 [LiteLLM 文档](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) 配置相应 API Key，例如：
        ```bash
        USE_AZURE_OPENAI=False
        LITELLM_DEFAULT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
        OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
        ```
    *   可根据需要添加 Google/Anthropic/Cohere 等额外变量，或为评估器设置 `EVALUATION_API_KEY`。

6.  **Run OpenAlpha_Evolve!**
    以 Dijkstra 示例启动：
    ```bash
    python main.py examples/shortest_path.yaml
    ```
    Watch the logs in your terminal to see the evolutionary process unfold! Log files are also saved to `alpha_evolve.log` (by default).

7.  **Launch the Gradio Web Interface**
    Interact with the system via the web UI. To start the Gradio app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Gradio will display a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860) and a public share link if enabled. Open this in your browser to define custom tasks and run the evolution process interactively.

### 🌲 Continuous Metrics Demo: Erdős 993

The repository now includes a fully metrics-driven benchmark inspired by AlphaEvolve's Erdős–Moser explorations. It treats the program under evolution as a **search heuristic** instead of a direct solver.

```bash
python -m main examples/erdos_993.yaml
```

Key facts:

- `evaluation_mode: "metrics"` tells the framework to import `examples.erdos_993_eval.evaluate_candidate`.
- Your candidate must implement `search_erdos_993(seed: int, budget: int) -> dict`, iterate over random seeds, and return telemetry such as `candidate`, `best_violation`, and `samples_tried`.
- The evaluator computes continuous metrics (`score`, `valid_ratio`, `runtime_penalty`, …) and SelectionController scalarizes them (primary key `score`, fallback linear weights).
- Even if no counter-example is found yet, the best violation magnitude provides a gradient for evolution, mirroring the “soft objectives” used in the original AlphaEvolve work.

## 💡 Defining Your Own Algorithmic Quests!

Want to challenge OpenAlpha_Evolve with a new problem? It's easy! You can define your tasks in two ways:

### 1. Using YAML Files (Recommended)

Create a YAML file in the `examples` directory with the following structure:

```yaml
task_id: "your_task_id"
task_description: |
  Your detailed problem description here.
  Be specific about function names, expected behavior, and constraints.
function_name: "your_function_name"
allowed_imports: ["module1", "module2"]

tests:
  - description: "Test group description" # Describes a group of related tests
    name: "Test group name" # A name for this test group
    test_cases: # This should be a list of individual test cases
      - input: [arg1, arg2]  # First test case
        output: expected_output # Expected result for this input
        # Each test case uses either 'output' for direct comparison
        # or 'validation_func' for more complex validation.
      - input: [arg_for_validation_func_1, arg_for_validation_func_2] # Second test case
        validation_func: |
          def validate(output_from_function):
              # Custom validation logic for this specific test case's output
              # For example, check if output is within a certain range,
              # or if it has specific properties.
              return isinstance(output_from_function, bool) and output_from_function is True
```

See the example in `examples/shortest_path.yaml`

#### Metrics Mode & Search Heuristics

For research-style problems (new combinatorial bounds, hardware heuristics, etc.) you can switch the task into metrics mode:

```yaml
evaluation_mode: "metrics"
metrics_eval_module: "examples.erdos_993_eval"
metrics_primary_key: "score"
metrics_scalarization:
  score: 1.0
  runtime_penalty: 0.1
metrics_config:
  seeds: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  budget: 512
```

Guidelines:

- Implement a *searcher* function (e.g., `search_erdos_993(seed: int, budget: int)`) that can continue exploration across generations. It should return telemetry such as `{"candidate": ..., "best_violation": 0.42, "samples_tried": 1024}`.
- Provide an evaluation module exposing `evaluate_candidate(program_module, task_definition) -> dict[str, float]`. This keeps heavy validation logic (simulators, proof checkers, etc.) outside of Docker test harnesses.
- Define a primary metric and optional scalarization weights so SelectionController can order individuals in multi-dimensional metric space.
- Check `examples/erdos_993.yaml` + `examples/erdos_993_eval.py` for a complete reference implementation.

### 2. Using Python Code (Legacy)

You can still define tasks programmatically using the `TaskDefinition` class:

```python
from core.task_definition import TaskDefinition

task = TaskDefinition(
    id="your_task_id",
    description="Your detailed problem description",
    function_name_to_evolve="your_function_name",
    input_output_examples=[
        {"input": [arg1, arg2], "output": expected_output},
        # More examples...
    ],
    allowed_imports=["module1", "module2"]
)
```

### Best Practices for Task Definition

Crafting effective task definitions is key to guiding OpenAlpha_Evolve successfully. Consider these tips:

*   **Be Clear and Unambiguous**: Write task descriptions as if you're explaining the problem to another developer. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it clearly.
*   **Provide Diverse and Comprehensive Examples**: Your test cases are the primary way the agent verifies its generated code.
    *   Include typical use cases
    *   Cover edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, etc.)
    *   Include examples that test different logical paths
    *   Use validation functions for complex checks
*   **Start Simple, Then Increase Complexity**: Break down complex problems into simpler versions first.
*   **Specify Constraints and Edge Cases**: Mention specific constraints and edge cases in the description.
*   **Define Expected Function Signature**: Clearly state the expected function name and parameters.
*   **Iterate and Refine**: Review and refine your task definition based on the agent's performance.
